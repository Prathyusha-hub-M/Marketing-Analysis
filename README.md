## ðŸ“š Project Background

**ShopEasy** is an e-commerce company that operates as an online retail marketplace, generating revenue through commission-based sales and subscription fees for premium seller services. The platform has been active for several years, thriving in a competitive and rapidly evolving online shopping industry. As the company scales, understanding and optimizing key business metrics such as customer acquisition cost (CAC), conversion rates, average order value (AOV), and customer lifetime value (CLTV) has become critical to ensuring profitability and growth. The business faces the challenge of improving customer engagement and maximizing value per transaction while maintaining platform performance. This project focuses on leveraging data to identify patterns and insights that drive smarter decision-making across marketing, user experience, and retention strategies.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
