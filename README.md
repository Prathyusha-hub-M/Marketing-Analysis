# Insights Deep Dive

### Reduced Customer Engagement

* **Declining Views.**  
  Views peaked in February and July but went down from August onward. This shows that audience interest decreased in the later half of the year.

* **Low Interaction Rates.**  
  Clicks and likes stayed low compared to views. This means the content might need to be more engaging or have clearer calls to action.

* **Content Type Performance.**  
  Social Media had a slightly higher percentage of views overall but blog content brought the most views especially in April and July, while social media and video content had steady but slightly lower engagement.

### Decreased Conversion Rates

* **Seasonal Conversion Patterns.**  
  Throughout the year, overall conversion rates rose and fell. Strong months like February and July showed many products converting well, which hints at seasonal buying. Learning from these months may help boost conversions during slower times.

* **Low Conversion Month.**  
  May had the lowest conversion rate at 4.3%. No product excelled during this month, suggesting that marketing plans or offers in May could be improved.

* **Peak Conversion Month.**  
  January recorded the highest conversion rate at 18.5%, likely driven by seasonal demand and effective early-year promotions.

* **Star Product Performance.**  
  Ski Boots stood out in January with a 150% conversion rate, showing that well-promoted products can drive big gains in the right season.
